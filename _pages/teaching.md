#### 2021, 2022, 2023: Algorithmics for Licences 2, at Sorbonne Université. 
> - Course supervisor : [Alix Munier](https://www.lip6.fr/actualite/personnes-fiche.php?ident=P653).
> - The objective of the course is:
>     - to learn how to evaluate and demonstrate the complexity and validity of an algorithm;
>     - to work on basic classical algorithms:
>         - on lists and arrays (sorting)
>         - on classical data structures (heap, binary search tree, ...)
>         - on directed and undirected graphs (bfs, dfs, ...).

#### 2020, 2021, 2022: [Elements of Python programming](https://www.editions-ellipses.fr/accueil/10671-elements-de-programmation-de-lalgorithme-au-programme-python-9782340041066.html) for Licences 1, at Sorbonne Université. 
> - Course supervisor : [Romain Demangeon](https://www-apr.lip6.fr/~demangeon/).
> - The goal of the course is to teach the basics of programming to students who have (almost) never practiced it.
