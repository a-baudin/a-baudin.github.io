I am a PhD student in the [Complex Networks](https://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team at [Lip6](https://www.lip6.fr/), [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) since 2020. My PhD is supervised by [Clémence Magnien](https://lip6.fr/Clemence.Magnien/) and [Lionel Tabourier](https://lioneltabourier.fr/).

I am currently working on graph algorithms, applied to massive real-world networks. I also study temporal graphs, with the [link stream formalism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04073), which allows to combine structural and temporal aspects of a dataset, taking into account the continuous aspect of time.

Before my PhD, I graduated from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) and [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/)  with a master in computer science research and software technology.

I am interested in interdisciplinary work. I have done various works in bioinformatics, and I am particularly interested in using the rich formalism of graphs for biological studies that involve complex interactions.
